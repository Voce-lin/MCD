python 3.7
# How to use
1,Download the project , install all the dependencies via requirements.txt
2,Run '''python python train_step.py '''to complete training, this will update the Cluster.csv and 3D_points.csv
3,RUN '''python python predict_step.py ''' to complete the test step, the detection results of the MCD algorithm on the dataset will be printed out like thisï¼š<br>

# Notice
The default dataset is the robin dataset, if you want to test other datasets, copy the dataset to the "data/" path and replace the file path on line 19 in "train_step.py". For example, modify it to:
'''python filepath=f'data/kpi_dataset/' '''
The csv file format of the dataset needs to be the same as the robin dataset.
